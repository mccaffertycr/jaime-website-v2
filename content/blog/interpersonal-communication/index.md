One of the first lessons a teacher needs to learn about corresponding with individual students is that open communication builds your relationships with students. This is a two-way street and a teacher must be both expressive as well as receptive in their communication (Bharti, 2015). I have to show who I am and be authentic and express that as much as you need to understand who my students are. Be a skilled listener and understand the thoughts and ideas of your students while being able to elaborate and communicate back at their level and understanding. The next thing is students know when a teacher is being authentic, be truthful to them. It does not protect your students if you flatter and not give them the truth if their work is not satisfactory. It is actually more harmful to them- so always be honest and forthright with students or they will know you are not being authentic (Fisher & Frey, 2018). Also, it is not only about what I say but how I say things to my students (Gavoni, 2015). A teacher can still establish a professional relationship with students without talking down at them or in a condescending manner. One more detailed point about interpersonal communication is that every situation has an appropriate time, place and way of communicating the most effectively- teachers need to become very good at reading the situation and responding appropriately. Every student is different, every parent is different, and every situation has a positive way of handling it.

A tremendous part of communicating to students is building relationships with them. As Rita Pierson (2013) would say, “You know, kids don’t learn from people they don’t like.” When a teacher does not have relationship building at the forefront of their mind, it can turn kids off to learning since they would not have a drive to succeed- from both a lack of passion for the subject matter compounded with a lack of engagement and respect for the teacher. When a relationship grows between a teacher and their students, a teacher will immediately see engagement in the classroom increase. This is due to the fact that trust has become a part of the relationship for the student. Douglas Fisher and Nancy Frey (2018) state that, “Students want to know their teachers really care about them as individuals and have their best academic and social interests at heart—and that teachers trust them...Students also want to know that their teachers are trustworthy and reliable” (Par. 6). When this connection is made, students want to engage with the teacher more due to the respect that is established on both ends of the relationship.

Lastly, respect and trust, in my perspective, are linked together. You cannot have one without the other and they are two of the most important factors in developing a positive and high functioning student-teacher relationship. The reason this is so important is that students want to be able to trust and rely on their teachers to get them through a stressful and pressure-filled time in their life. I want them to have faith in me, and see me as trustworthy and reliable to help them through these years.
