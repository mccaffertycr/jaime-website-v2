In the “Teamwork” topic, the valued resource of the community that a person works in is discussed. I use my colleagues all the time for different resources, ideas, and lessons that can be adjusted and used in my own teaching style. Administrators coming into my classroom and observing have also elevated lessons after they have given great ideas to revise a lesson, so using the community as a resource has definitely been one of the most helpful experiences in my short teaching career. However, having access to colleagues can be challenging with the many demands of a teacher’s schedule. The more that teachers get comfortable with the rapidly advancing technology, the more equipped they are to teach in the modern world. I have no doubt that school systems will begin to implement more virtual classrooms so that teachers can address wider audiences while staying within their classrooms. Also, major data storage systems, such as Google Drive, enable teachers to send major projects and huge chunks of their curriculum without carrying binders and binders worth of curricula. This can only help collaboration since teachers can send the entire class’ worth of information with a touch of a button.

#### Educational Technology Resources

Going outside the resource of community, technology has changed the way that people communicate and in turn it changes the way we educate. Teachers have never been able to share as much content, lesson plans, materials, and advice on such a large scale with the development of the internet. Social media platforms are filled with tips for teachers or ways to improve lessons. However, with the social media platforms, teachers need to be careful that they are not damaging their own image and the image of their schools and districts (Teachers and social media, 2016). When executed appropriately, social media is a powerful tool for sharing ideas and collaborating with teachers that people did not have access to in the past.

In my own school, emailing and cell phones enable us to be in touch with each other to collaborate in a professional manner while at home (Friend, 2017). This was explored firsthand with the COVID-19 epidemic and how teachers were able to redesign their curriculum in a manner of days. From my own standpoint, I collaborated with two other teachers that were teaching the same two classes as me and we were able to help build each other’s classes by being in each other’s Google Classroom. Some of the most impactful advances have been the technologies that enable us to have virtual classrooms such as Google Meets, Zoom, and Microsoft Team. By having these tools, education has continued despite the massive shut downs on a global scale. Many corporations and communities pulled together in order to offer access to different applications and platforms that enabled virtual classrooms to continue through the Spring and the upcoming Fall semesters, such as Zoom. As these companies work to upgrade their platforms, I want to stay current with all they have to offer so that I can continue to utilize the resource to its fullest potential. One example is in the Spring I was not able to do Breakout Rooms in my Zoom virtual classroom. Over the summer, however, I have been watching videos and reading as to how to better make my virtual classroom interactive and now I can have group discussions in Breakout Rooms, among other useful resources. This is something my school community has encouraged through the summer in order to more effectively communicate and engage with my students.
